==============================================================
Continuation:
Set up connection inside Program.cs
On the Project, each member should have their own builder statement (backend dependency connection) - use subsystem name for your builder name ie[ReceivingBackendDependencies]
	
1. Add extension on your ChinookSystem
	Add class and name it "ChinookExtensions" - an add-on method to existing class (IServiceCollection)
		- Add #region Additional Namespaces
		- Change the "internal" to "public static" class
		- Add your method on the class named "ChinookSystemBackendDependencies"
		- Add your parameters with variable name services(this IServiceCollection services)
		- Add your action with variable name options which receive the connection string for your application "Action<DbContextOptionsBuilder> options"
2. On Program.cs
	Uncomment the builder method, and add in a using statement to connect the system (using ChinookSystem)
3. On ChinookExtension.cs
		- create a Transient Service Class on BLL folder
			- On BLL folderm create a new class (TrackServices.cs) *singular* and needs to be public
		- Add TrackServices class to register on ChinookExtensions.cs
		- Add a constructor for context dependency on TrackServices
		- Create a PlaylistTrackServices class (copy codes from TrackServices class)
		- Copy the services. code for TrackServices and change the class name to PlaylistTrackServices
		- Save all and Rebuild Solution

=======================================================================

1. Grab the TrackSelection method from Linqpad (TrackServices Class) and paste to you TrackServices.cs under #region Queries
2. Change the IEnumerable<TrackSelection> results = Tracks to "_context.Tracks". Do the same for PlaylistTrackServices.
3. Add your Services region on PlaylistTrackServices, grab your Command TRX method from linq and paste it in here. 
	- Change your class name to singular
	- add "_context." to all queries and dataset
	- remove "s" to all instance, local variables
	- add #nullable disable on top of your using statements
